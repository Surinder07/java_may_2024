Problem 1: 

Create a Java program for a simple online bookstore. Each book has a title, author, price, and quantity available in stock. Implement the following functionalities:

Create a Book class with instance variables for title, author, price, and quantity.
Implement a constructor to initialize these instance variables.
Implement a static method in the Book class to calculate the total price of a given quantity of books.
Create multiple instances of the Book class and demonstrate the use of the constructor and static method.
You can extend this problem by adding more functionalities like adding books to a shopping cart, updating stock quantities, etc.


Problem 2 :
You are tasked with creating a simple banking system. Implement a Java program with the following requirements:

Create a BankAccount class with instance variables for account number, account holder name, and balance.
Implement a constructor to initialize these instance variables.
Implement a static variable to keep track of the total number of accounts created.
Implement a static method to display the total number of accounts created.
Create multiple instances of the BankAccount class and demonstrate the use of the constructor and static method.
You can extend this problem by adding functionalities like deposit, withdraw, check balance, etc., and demonstrate how they work with multiple bank account instances.
