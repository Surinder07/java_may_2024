# Conside the given array
number[] = 10,30,43,54,23,543,43,32
1. Reverse the array
2. find the maximum element
3. find the minimum element
4. find the second maximum
5. find the second minimum
6. find the sum of all the elements in array
7. find average of all the elements in array
8. add two 3x3 arrays  
   int[][] array1= {{54,12,4}, {2,36,40}, {6,4,5}}
   int[][] array2 = {{2,9,40}, {5,3,6}, {3,5,12}}
9. create a char array
   characters A , B , C , D

## Strings

1. Create a program to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
2. Develop a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.
3. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. []
4. Write a Java program that takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of words in it. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The program should maintain the order of characters within each word.

For example:

Input: "Hello World"
Output: "World Hello"

Input: "Java Programming is Fun"
Output: "Fun is Programming Java"
